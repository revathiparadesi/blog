                <p>Humans are the most common and widespread species of primate.<br> Humans are 
                    broadly characterized by their bipedalism and high intelligence.<br> Humans' large brain and resulting cognitive <br>skills have allowed them to thrive in a variety of environments and develop <br>complex societies and civilizations.</p>
                <p>Human life process includes organization, <br>metabolism, responsiveness, movements, reproduction, growth, differentiation,<br> respiration, digestion, and excretion.<br> All these processes work together, in fine-tuned balance,<br> for the well-being of the individual and to maintain life.</p>

                <p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia.<br> With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move,<br>can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells,<br> the blastula, during embryonic development</p>
                <p>Why are animals important to life?<br>
                    Animals improve the welfare of humans in many ways, ranging from providing companionship, <br>improving mental health, facilitating rescues during natural disasters; and finally, for a number of species, as food.<br> Dogs used in therapy, and as aids for people with disabilities, provide important benefits.

                    Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support.<br> Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals.<br> The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their metabolisms that have evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.</p>
